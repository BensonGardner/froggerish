## Froggerish

Froggerish is a simple game where the player tries to evade insects who move at a variety of speeds across the playing field.

## Features

Gems appear periodically which allow players to "powerUp" and catch the insects.

When the game is won, it restarts with additional difficulty.

## How to Install

Download the Froggerish folder, including the INDEX.HTML file, along with folders for /images/, /js/, and /css/.

Load INDEX.HTML to play the game.

## License Information

The images and basic concept for the game were created by Udacity.com and presumably owned thereby.

Variations were created by Benson Gardner as part of a Udacity course.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
