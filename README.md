## Froggerish

Froggerish is a simple game where the player tries to evade insects who move at a variety of speeds across the playing field.

## Features

Gems appear periodically which allow players to "powerUp" and catch the insects.

When the game is won, it restarts with additional difficulty.

## How to Install

Download the Froggerish folder, including the INDEX.HTML file, along with folders for /images/, /js/, and /css/.

Load INDEX.HTML to play the game.

## License Information

The images and basic concept for the game were created by Udacity.com and presumably owned thereby.

Variations were created by Benson Gardner as part of a Udacity course.
