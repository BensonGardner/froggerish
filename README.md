# Froggerish

Froggerish is a simple game where the player tries to evade insects who move at a variety of speeds across the playing field.

## How to Install

Download the Froggerish folder, including the `index.html` file, along with folders for `images`, `js`, and `css`.

Load `index.html` to play the game.

## How to Play

You are trying to get back to your home at the bottom of the River Jyn, but a swarm of nasty giant
insects have taken over the land! Can you get back to your watery home without hitting an insect?

Luckily, the Sparkly Wizard of Forre will send as many gems as she can to help you "power up." Grab a gem and the mean bugs will run away from you - for good reason!

Move your character around the game board using the arrow keys, and try to reach the river.

If you reach the river, the game will restart with greater difficulty.

## Notes on Customization

The game imitates Udacity's provided demo, with a few exceptions for the sake of customization:

1. The character has been changed to another of the provided characters (of the same size).
2. There are more insects, for added challenge.
3. Gems appear which scare the bugs and allow the player to defeat the bugs.
4. On reaching the water, the game starts over with faster-moving enemies.

## License Information

The images and basic concept for the game were created by Udacity.com and presumably owned thereby.

Variations were created by Benson Gardner as part of a Udacity course.
