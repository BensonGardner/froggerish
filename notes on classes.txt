insects need to appear 
within one of the three paved rows

they have the same image, and varyign speeds

I would like to create a subclass that accelerates when it sees you and/or runs away when you move toward it.
    (if the interactin with teh palyer is tooc omplicated to implement ,i could ust make it that some insects speed up when they see you and some slow down. 
   The varying speed is a fun way to create subclasses of insects.

the player is a differnet image. it moves only in response to keystrokes. it takes up less room than an insect. it moves in big bursts, instead of gradually. what it has in common with the insects:
	it is on top of the background
	it needs to have its location updated 

You do have to recreate the player when game is reset. you also have to update the player's location. 

you need to update the insects' location, too.

when they are updated and revela overlap of some kind, then the game has to be reset.

Maybe it will be like this:

background

var Creature = function(loc){
        
};

var Insect = funtion(loc){
   Creature.call(this, loc);
}
Insect.prototype = Object.create(Creature.prototype);
Insect.prototype.constructor = Insect;
Insect.prototype.move = function{ 
};

//then a subclass of Insect that's a speeding up or slowing down insect.

// then another subclass of Creature that's the Player. it will have its own move function. I'm not sure that the player and insects need to be subclasses of teh same class. 


	
We could have other characters running along and if they catch you you get something like a gem.

each entity needs to have a property that is a function, celled render() and another called update(). 

you can check for collisions either as part of the entities' update() functions or in the engine's updating process.
